     * In a game engine, various different task have to be done, such as navigating a menu, 
     * playing intro videos, cutscenes, actual gameplay and many more. It's not feasible to 
     * build all that functionality staticaly somewhere in your code.
     * To do this, we implement GameStates, based on the State pattern.
     *
     * The gamestates will be managed in a stack, so switching between a previous or a following state is as easy as pushing it onto the stack.
