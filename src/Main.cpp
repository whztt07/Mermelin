 *
 * The CotopaxiEngine is a 3D game engine, based on OGRE, Bullet, SFML and libRocket.
 * It begun as a student project intended to teach game engine design as well as being a learning 
 * experience. It was a colaboration between Patrick Joos and Eduardo Hahn Paredes at the
 * Bern University of Applied Science in Berne from 2012 to 2013.

 * The most important library in this project is OGRE.
